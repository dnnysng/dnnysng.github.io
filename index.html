    <h2>Hey, what's up?</h2>

    <p>
    My name is Danny and I enjoy <em>creating</em>. I learned how to design
    using graphics software at a young age and it became my "thing" growing up.
    Last year, I started taking on projects building sites on WordPress. It was
    fun designing pages using existing themes, but I wanted more control over
    how the pages looked. I decided to learn how to code and began studying on
    May 1, 2018.

  <blockquote>
    <div class='countup' id="countup">
      "I've been coding for
      <p id="days">00</p>
      <p class="timeRefDays">days</p>
      now."
    </div>
  </blockquote>

    My first project is this portfolio page and I plan to continue updating
    it using new things that I learn along the way. My goals are to continue
    growing as both a developer and a designer as I build amazing things.

    With that said, I post my work on
    <a href='https://www.github.com/dseng13' target='_blank'>Github</a>.
    Sometimes work gets difficult and I <s>complain</s> find motivation on
    <a href='https://www.twitter.com/dseng13' target='_blank'>Twitter</a>.
    Eventually, I figure things out and I post the best angles of my work on
    <a href='https://www.instagram.com/dseng13' target='_blank'>Instagram</a>.
    If you have time, you can follow my process on

    <h4>I look forward to hearing from you!</h4>
